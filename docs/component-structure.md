# Component Structure and Architecture

This document outlines the component structure and architecture for the playlist transfer web app. Our application is built using React, with Zustand for efficient state management. This structure is designed to offer a scalable and maintainable codebase.

## Core Components

### `App`

- **Responsibilities**: Serves as the root component that wraps the entire application. It includes routing setup and global context providers if necessary.
- **Path**: `src/App.js`

### `Navbar`

- **Responsibilities**: Provides navigation links to different parts of the application, enabling users to easily switch between views.
- **Path**: `src/components/Navbar/Navbar.js`

### `PlaylistList`

- **Responsibilities**: Fetches and displays a list of user playlists. It acts as a container for `PlaylistItem` components.
- **Path**: `src/components/PlaylistList/PlaylistList.js`

#### `PlaylistItem`

- **Responsibilities**: Represents a single playlist in the list. Displays the playlist name and summary, and may include action buttons like "View Details" or "Transfer".
- **Path**: `src/components/PlaylistItem/PlaylistItem.js`

### `PlaylistDetail`

- **Responsibilities**: Provides detailed information about a playlist, including tracks, descriptions, and transfer options.
- **Path**: `src/components/PlaylistDetail/PlaylistDetail.js`

### `TransferForm`

- **Responsibilities**: Handles the selection of playlists and destination service for transferring. Includes form inputs for user interaction.
- **Path**: `src/components/TransferForm/TransferForm.js`

## State Management with Zustand

Our application uses Zustand to manage global and local states. Zustand stores are split based on features or functionality, enhancing modularity and ease of use.

### Example Store: `usePlaylistStore`

- **Responsibilities**: Manages the state related to playlists, including the list of playlists, adding, and removing playlists.
<!-- - **Path**: `src/stores/playlistStore.js` -->
